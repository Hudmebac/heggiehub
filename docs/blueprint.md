- Primary Color: Neutral off-white (#FAFAFA) for a clean, modern look in Light Mode; Deep charcoal black (#121212) for a sharp contrast in Dark Mode.
- Secondary Color: Vibrant orange (#FF6B00) to add energy and highlight key elements in Light Mode; Burnt orange (#E65100) for a rich, bold effect in Dark Mode.
- Accent Color: Electric orange (#FFA500) for interactive elements, hover effects, and buttons. Subtle gradient transitions for a sleek feel.
- Use a bold, futuristic sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins, or Inter). Headers in uppercase with slight letter-spacing for emphasis.
- Sharp, card-based design to neatly showcase apps and tools. Subtle elevation (box shadows) to add depth.
- Fluid micro-interactions: Subtle motion when switching themes. Animated section transitions for a smooth, engaging experience. Bold hero section: Make your bio pop with an animated intro message.
- Minimalist, monochrome iconsâ€”white in dark mode, black in light mode. Outline + filled versions for interactive elements.
- Rounded, high-contrast buttons with hover glow. Press effects: Buttons subtly compress when clicked.
